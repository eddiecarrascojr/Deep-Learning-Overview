# Feed Forward Networks
In this repo you will find a list of feed forward networks everyone should know. They will be implimented first in Keras, then a person can choose to follow the code in either PyTorch or Tensorflow; the two most popular frameworks for deep learning.

The list of NN are as followed.

- Perceptron
- CNN
- Autoencoder
- Deep Stack Network
- Recurrent Neural Network
